# simple reformatting for csv values. 

To run: 
`python3 gauto.py`

Supply the .csv file: `fileName.csv`
Check auto_output.txt for formatted text.

Notes: 
- your system might have a different version associated with the `python` command, so `python gauto.py` might also be fine.

- script assumes delimiters are ',' and quotes are ' " ' characters when converting to .csv from .ods

- assumes header with first entry ignored, rest pre-pended: to row-value matches
